# Data Analysis; Logistic Regression Model used to Predict the Probability of Default of Credit Card Customers
===
***

### This is an example analysis of creating a binomial logistic regression model to predict the probability of default of credit card customers.  The data was obtained from the [**University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) and the example was based on the paper by [I-Cheng Yeh and Che-hui Lien](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-comparisons-of-data-mining-techniques-for-the-Yeh-Lien/1cacac4f0ea9fdff3cd88c151c94115a9fddcf33/pdf).

### In this data set, "y" is the class or dependant variable.

Definition of the logistic function $\sigma(x)$.
$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
$$

x = -8:8
y = 1/(1 + exp(-x))
plot(x,y,type="n",main="Logistic Function")
lines(x,y)
x = -8:8
y = 1/(1 + exp(-x))
plot(x,y,type="n",main="Logistic Function")
lines(x,y)

If $x$ is a linear function then the argument to the logistic function can be written as a linear system.

$$
F(x) = 1/(1 + exp(-Ax))
$$

 $F(x)$ can be interpretted as the probability of the independent variable $x$ producing an output of 1 given the design matrix $A$.
 
When training a binomial logistic regression model we are interested in the inverse problem.  That is, given a set of examples what is the optimal value of $A$.

$$
g(F(x)) = ln(\frac{F(x)}{1-F(x)}) = Ax
$$
$$
\frac{F(x)}{1-F(x)} = e^{Ax}
$$
x = -8:8x = -8:8
y = 1/(1 + exp(-x))
plot(x,y,type="n",main="Logistic Function")
lines(x,y)

y = 1/(1 + exp(-x))
plot(x,y,type="n",main="Logistic Function")
lines(x,y)
  
Note that the $g$, called the *logit* function, is equivalent to simple linear regression and
is also the log odds of F(x).
